# meetslots

## Motivation
I have found that at certain times I am to provide availabilities for people that don't have visibility 
into my calendar. It doesn't happen often enough for me to be running a tool such as Calendly to handle 
these cases, but I thought it would be useful to be able to extract empty slots based on a couple of 
rules

## Limitations

I don't intend this to be a project anyone cares about but me. I don't plan to deploy this as an app. 
It's meant to be a script that helps me with a task I personally find annoying. You know, the kind that
takes 5 min to do everytime, you do it once per month maybe and there's the nagging feeling that you could
sink a couple of hours into solving it for yourself which won't have a great ROI, but the nagging feeling
goes away.
